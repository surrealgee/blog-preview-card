## My process

### Built with

HTML
CSS
BEM

### What I learned

I decided to use BEM for the first time. I think it's a really useful methodology.

I liked it because I don't have to struggle thinking about class names anymore, at leat for this small projects.

I would like to see how it will help me in the future when I work on bigger projects.

### Continued development

As this was just a small component this project it's finished as it is. Although if I learn something new that I can apply here I may come back to it.
